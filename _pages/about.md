My research spans the fields of machine learning, computer vision and robotics. 
One area I am focused is the broad field of **spatial intelligence**, particularly for what concerns **localization** (understand where an observation is in space) and **fine grained understanding** (understand the fine details in the observations).  

A second thread of my reasearch is more related to pure learning, and particularly to **reliable machine learning**, **distributed machine learning**, **edge machine learning** and **continuous functional learning**. The common denominator is to try and make models that can be deployed to real world applications.

From 2009 to 2017 I was a researcher at the Autonomous Robotics and Human Machine Systems group within the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics](https://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/en) in TÃ¼bingen (Germany). I started there as a visiting master and by the end I was a Postdoc.
During that time, I worked mainly on problems of model based shared control and planning for various robotics platforms, including anthropomorphic manipulators, teams of drones and cable-driven parallel robots.

I also had a brief stint in industry, between 2017 and 2020, working as an autonomous driving specialist at [Italdesign](https://www.italdesign.it/). During that time I contributed to the development of autonomous/assisted concept vehicles, focusing mainly on motion planning and perception. Among the projects I worked on, there are [Pop.Up Next](https://www.italdesign.it/project/pop-up-next/) and [WheeM-i](https://www.italdesign.it/project/wheem-i/).
